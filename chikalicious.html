				In the Spring of 2015, I worked on a final project for my internet marketing class at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Everyone in the class was asked to choose a bakery or dessert restaurant, and to create a marketing campaign for the brand. We were also asked to explore any other tactics to help the brand.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				My partner and I chose ChikaLicious, a New York dessert bar. The first major problem we noticed was the lack of unity for each of the brand's locations. Each dessert bar had its own website and social media. We decided that the most important ways to help ChikaLicious were to create a user-friendly website for all locations that drove reservations, and to unify the social media. Besides developing a new website via Squarespace for the brand, we used a social influencer and social currency campaign, as well as digital advertising in our marketing plan. Take a look at the presentation below, and yes, that is indeed Rick Ross at the end of the deck.
